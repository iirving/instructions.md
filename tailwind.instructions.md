- Configure content paths to include all relevant template files
- Set up proper Tailwind plugins for additional functionality
- Define consistent color palette and typography within theme

## Layout Patterns

- Use Flexbox and Grid for modern layouts
- Implement proper responsive design with Tailwind's breakpoint prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)

## Custom Components

- Create custom components by composing Tailwind utility classes
- Extract repeating patterns to reusable components
- Use @apply sparingly and only for highly reused patterns

## Performance Optimization

- Use Tailwind's JIT mode for optimal CSS bundle size
